Vehicles change routes
http://localhost:8080/agencies/ttc
http://restbus.info/

find all routes
http://localhost:8080/agencies/ttc/routes/
then find the route you want to track
http://localhost:8080/agencies/ttc/routes/68
using stop predictions to find the vehicle ID on route
http://localhost:8080/agencies/ttc/stops/10534/predictions
tracking vehicle on warden 68 
http://localhost:8080/agencies/ttc/vehicles/8709

http://localhost:8080/agencies/ttc/routes/506

https://www.npmjs.com/package/file-system may need to write files?


the routes are based on the bus numbers:
http://localhost:8080/agencies/ttc/routes/506 
within this link I get information on: detail stop info on the entire route (array of object), 2 sets of stop array (based on N-S/ E-W bound direction), the path (array) coordinates (so I can map out the route line)

http://localhost:8080/agencies/ttc/vehicles/ (array of object)
this gives a list of ALL vehicle ids, route ID, location the lat and long 
Perhaps I can sort through this to get IDs of the routes I plan to target?
Concern: not sure if buses that are not in used are going to show up?
Does it show which direction is it going? Cannot find out what "heading" is yet
